 USDA Visit 

---

We visited Appalachian Fruit Research Station of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in Kearneysville, West Virginia. Our collaborator, **Dr. Surya Sapkota** hosted us. Dr. Sapkota has newly established a grape breeding program that is focused on improving grape genetics to sustain challenges of mid-Atlantic to east South Central United States. Abby (Abigail Scott) learned grape propagation techniques, whereas Anugya learned high-throughput downy mildew phenotyping using Dr. Sapkota's amazing [**Blackbird**](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PHYTO-01-25-0033-R) robotic system.
