The CoEvolutionLab will be set up in the Lab # 339 in Agriculture and Natural Resources Building. The new look building is well-equipped for the needs of the lab. Plenty of glass to chalk out new experiments, draw models, and come up with new strategies. Student offices are just next doors too, with plenty of sunshine!!!!
