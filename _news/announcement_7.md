Laying Foundation for Blue Ridge Mountains' Wild Grape Germaplasm

Abby and Brayden are setting up the greenhouse facility to grow our collections from the National Forests. Foggers are specifically being installed to promote rooting of the green-wood and hard-wood cuttings of differnent <i> Vitis </i> spp. 

Brayden got soaked in water when a PVC pipe burst due to high pressure, so it is still "work in progress"!!
