Anugya received Graduate Student Research Award of $5000 from University of Tennessee’s Graduate School for her project “Identifying hotspots of genetic diversity in Tennessee’s wild grape populations to combat downy mildew disease”

---
Her research will provide critical insights into the region’s wild grape genetic diversity, identifying Downy Mildew (DM) resistance hotspots to support breeders in developing regionally adapted DM resistant cultivars. Additionally, it will help in informed decision-making to conservationists and land managers, particularly in the national forests where vegetation is heavily regulated for the in situ conservation of genetically diverse populations.
