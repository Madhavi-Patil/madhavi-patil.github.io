Three new members for summer sampling 2025

---
We're thrilled to welcome three talented new members who will be integral to our summer 2025 sampling efforts across a range of fascinating locations:

Brayden Roberts will be collaborating with graduate student Anugya Bhattarai, venturing into the diverse ecosystems of Monongahela National Forest (West Virginia), Washington and Jefferson National Forests (Virginia), and Tennessee's own Cherokee National Forest.
    
Jacob Smith is set to join Katie Wood's team for an expedition within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, exploring the <em> Vitis </em> spp. diversity of different disturbance zones.
    
    
Abby Scott will be working alongside Gautam on a crucial mission to locate <em> Plasmopara viticola </em> within the National Forests and collect cuttings for propagation.

We are looking forward to a productive, adventurous, and insightful summer with Brayden, Jacob, and Abby on board!!!
