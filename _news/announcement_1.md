David received a 2024 Fulbright U.S. Student Research Fellowship to Indonesia with a project investigating the reclamation of tin mines and sustainability in the palm oil industry. He has assisted on projects across the broad spectrum of forestry-related topics such as fire behavior, remote sensing, fungal pathogens, and degraded land restoration. He seeks to earn a graduate degree in natural resources and would like to work on large-scale environmental projects. He worked as CoEvolutionLab's *GIS manager* in 2024, and his contributions were pivotal in obtaining research permits from various national/state forests and parks of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina.
