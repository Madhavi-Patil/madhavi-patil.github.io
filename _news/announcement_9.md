Anugya's quest for automating downy mildew phenotyping got boost from the APS. 
---
With the support from the APS Anugya will visit Dr. Surya Sapkota's lab at the USDA-ARS Appalachian Fruit Research Station in Kearneysville, West Virginia. 
She aims to master deep learning methods and robotic infrastructure for high-throughput, quantitative screening of wild grapes for downy mildew disease resistance. 
Anugya plans to apply this technique to understand the genetics of disease resistance in wild grape populations across Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.
