Crop wild relatives (CWRs) serve as vital reservoirs of genetic variation for crop improvement. North America is home to approximately 30 wild Vitis species  with Tennessee being home to many of them. While species richness is exceptionally high in the eastern United States, specifically in Appalachia, the genetic diversity within and across these species remains poorly characterized. The regionâ€™s significant elevation gradients and microclimatic variations likely contribute to allelic richness for stress and disease resistance in wild grapes.
