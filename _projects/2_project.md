title: Wild Grape-Downy Mildew Interaction
description: 
importance: 2
category: Current
---

Downy mildew, caused by the oomycete <em>Plasmopara viticola</em>, poses a significant annual threat to vineyards throughout Appalachia and surrounding regions, demanding considerable monitoring and control investments. While cultivated Eurasian grapevines exhibit high susceptibility, native North American wild grapes, particularly those from the eastern part of the continent, demonstrate notable resistance. Our lab is employing genomics, population genomics, statistical genetics, and plant pathology to unravel key aspects of this economically vital pathosystem, specifically addressing:

1. Does a geographic mosaic of coevolution exist within this pathosystem across the Blue Ridge Mountains of Appalachia?
2. Which genomic regions in both the host and pathogen exhibit signatures of rapid, reciprocal coevolution?
3. What are the migration dynamics of <em>Plasmopara viticola</em> strains between wild and cultivated grape populations?
