              regulation of Spl11-mediated PCD, we performed a genetic screen

              These suppressors were characterized for their resistance to X.
              oryzae pv. oryzae and M. oryzae and for their expression of
              defense-related genes. The suppression of the cell-death

              proteins are the major immune receptors in plants, the mechanism
              that controls their activation and immune signaling remains
              elusive. Here, we report that the avirulence effector AvrPiz-t
              from Magnaporthe oryzae targets the rice E3 ligase APIP10 for
              degradation, but that APIP10, in return, ubiquitinates AvrPiz-t
              and thereby causes its degradation. Silencing of APIP10 in the
              non-Piz-t background compromises the basal defense against M.
              oryzae. Conversely, silencing of APIP10 in the Piz-t background
              causes cell death, significant accumulation of Piz-t, and enhanced
              resistance to M. oryzae, suggesting that APIP10 is a negative
              regulator of Piz-t. We show that APIP10 promotes degradation of
              Piz-t via the 26S proteasome system. Furthermore, we demonstrate
              that AvrPiz-t stabilizes Piz-t during M. oryzae infection.
              Together, our results show that APIP10 is a novel E3 ligase that

               that the M. oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the host

               generated double (K1,2R-AvrPiz-t), triple (K1,2,3R-AvrPiz-t) and
               lysine-free (LF-AvrPiz-t) mutants by mutating lysines into
