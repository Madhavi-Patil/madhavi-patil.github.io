2. **EPP604 (Spring 2025) Plant Immunity: System and Evolution (3 credits)**
Plant Disease resistance is crucial for global food security. In this course, students will learn about:

- the fundamental components of the plant immune system

- how these components evolve in the face of an arms race from competing pathogens
- Application of Information Theory to plant immunity and its evolution

This course is designed for graduate students (upper-undergraduates will be considered) with a basic understanding of biology, genetics, evolutionary biology, and programming (Python). By the course's end, students will understand the complex world of plant immunity and appreciate its significance in agriculture, and the environment.
