  Abigail is a junior majoring in the Plant Science program at the University of Tennessee. She is passionate about improving plant health, particularly through the study of plant diseases and their long-term effects on plant lifespan and quality. Currently, Abigail is channeling her energy into a challenging project centered on maximizing the propagation efficiency of wild Vitis species indigenous to the Blue Ridge Mountains. By skillfully integrating her hands-on experience in greenhouse plant production with her knowledge of diverse plant propagation techniques, she is meticulously investigating the optimal combination of cutting type (greenwood versus hardwood), sampling time, and greenhouse environmental conditions for successful Vitis propagation.
