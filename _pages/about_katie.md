Driven by her roots as a first-generation college student from rural East Tennessee, Katie forged her path to higher education, beginning with the Tennessee Promise at PSTCC before completing her B.B.A. While working at UTK and leveraging employer benefits, she discovered a profound passion for the interconnected fields of ecology, evolution, plant pathology, conservation biology, and bioinformatics. Now, in the CoEvolutionLab, Katie's research delves into the potential impacts of historical anthropogenic activities (logging and settlements) within Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the genetic diversity of native wild grapevines â€“ a pursuit that brings her genuine joy and a strong sense of accomplishment.
