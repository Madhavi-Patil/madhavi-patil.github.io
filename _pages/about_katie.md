As a first-generation college student from rural East Tennessee, Katie navigated her own path to higher education, starting with the Tennessee Promise at PSTCC before earning a Bachelor's in Business Administration. However, working at UTK opened her eyes to the vibrant world of research. Utilizing the employer benefit, she explored various fields and discovered a deep passion for the interdisciplinary intersection of ecology, evolution, plant pathology, conservation biology, and bioinformatics. Katie is passionate about doing research that will have a positive impact on the world. She is deeply intrigued by dynamic ecological systems, including plant interactions with people, insects, and pathogens. She utilizes different analytical approaches to investigate these complex systems through bioinformatics. Her fascination with these dynamic ecological systems, particularly plant interactions with people and pathogens, leads her to her research on how anthropogenic disturbances affect wild grapevines and their immunogenetic landscape in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.
