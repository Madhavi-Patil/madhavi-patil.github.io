As a first-generation college student from rural East Tennessee, Katie navigated her own path to higher education, starting with the Tennessee Promise at PSTCC before earning a Bachelor's in Business Administration. However, working at UTK opened her eyes to the vibrant world of research. Utilizing the employer benefit, she explored various fields and discovered a deep passion for the interdisciplinary intersection of ecology, evolution, plant pathology, conservation biology, and bioinformatics. She is incredibly grateful to now be pursuing this passion within the Coevolution Lab, where she contributes to research that brings her genuine joy
