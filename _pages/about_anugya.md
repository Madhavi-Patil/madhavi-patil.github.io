  Anugya completed her B.S. Agriculture from Nepal and is now a graduate student in the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology at UTK. Her research focuses on studying the genetic diversity of wild grape populations and their interaction with the downy mildew pathogen *Plasmopara viticola*. Her project involves extensive sampling across national forests in Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, analyzing both host and pathogen diversity to uncover patterns of co-evolution in the grape-downy mildew pathosystem at the genomic level. She is also testing interactions between different grape populations and pathogen isolates in controlled environments (greenhouse/growth chambers) to identify geographic mosaics of coevolution in the pathosystem.
  When she is not investigating host-pathogen interactions in the lab or the field or in the computer, you’ll likely find her lost in classic literature, trekking through nature’s wonders, or portraying those wonders on a canvas with colors. A small trivia — She has yet to climb Mount Everest!
