  Anugya is a Masterâ€™s student in Plant Pathology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology. Her research focuses on studying the genetic diversity of wild grape populations and their interaction with the downy mildew pathogen *Plasmopara viticola*. Her project involves extensive sampling across national forests in Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, analyzing both host and pathogen diversity to uncover patterns of co-evolution in the grape-downy mildew pathosystem at the genomic level. She is also testing interactions between different grape populations and pathogen isolates in controlled environments (greenhouse/growth chambers) to identify geographic mosaics of coevolution in the pathosystem.
