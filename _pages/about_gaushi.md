   I look forward to unraveling how crop wild relatives and pathogens coevolve in their natural habitats. In the long term, I plan to develop an analytical framework that focuses on restricting the emergence of new pathogenic strains through optimal use of the “wild” ancestry in cultivated crops. I also look forward to training a new generation of plant pathologists who will discover the evolutionary principles of host-pathogen interactions at the population and genomic level which can then be utilized for sustainable crop disease management.
