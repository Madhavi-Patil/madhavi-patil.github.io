Gautam earned his PhD from the Ohio State University before embarking on a research journey to Germany where he worked as post-doctoral scholar at the Max Planck Institute for Biology, Tuebingen. Driven by the curiosity and broad training he received, he is currently focused on illuminating the intricate coevolutionary dynamics between crop wild relatives and their pathogens within their native environments.  In the long term, he plans to develop an analytical framework that strategically leverages the untapped genetic heritage found in wild crop ancestors to restrict the emergence of novel and threatening pathogenic strains. 
  
Beyond his research endeavors, Gautam is dedicated to mentoring the next generation of plant biologists, equipping them with the skills to uncover the fundamental evolutionary principles governing host-pathogen interactions at both population and genomic levels. This knowledge will be instrumental in forging sustainable and resilient strategies for managing crop diseases in the future.
