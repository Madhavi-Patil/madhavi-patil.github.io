  <br>
  Brayden is an undergraduate pursuing a B.S. in Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences with a concentration in Management. Growing up outdoors helped him to be passionate for wildlife conservation. His research interests are in carnivore ecology, avoidance of human-wildlife conflict, and sustainable hunting's conservation function. He has background in vegetation management and is building hands-on experience through field experience in animal behavior, habitat rehabilitation, and ecological surveys (which involes his current stint with us helping Anugya achieve her goals). He aspires to become a wildlife manager who strives for activities that reconcile ecological integrity with human existence.
