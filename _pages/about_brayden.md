His research goals are carnivore ecology, avoidance of human-wildlife conflict, and sustainable hunting's conservation function. He has background experience in vegetation management and is building hands-on experience through field experience in animal behavior, habitat rehabilitation, and ecological surveys. Driven by a strong work ethic and deep respect for nature, he aspires to become a wildlife manager who strives for activities that reconcile ecological integrity with human existence.
