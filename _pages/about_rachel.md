  <br>
  Rachel began as a Herbert Experiential Research Opportunity (HERO) intern in the CoEvolutionLab during Summer 2024. Since then she has earned B.S. in Wildlife and Fisheries Science from UTK and continued her work while taking on new responsibilities of managing the lab. Grape samples collected from the forests are challenging to extract DNA from, and she has taken on the challenge to developing a cost-effective DNA extraction protocol from the _Vitis_ samples collected from the wild. She is particularly interested in obtaining high quality and quantity DNA suitable for both long and short-read sequencing. Her signficant interest beyond grapes lies in aquatic ecology and she dreams of pursuing research in freshwater mussel ecology. Outside of the lab, she loves reading books and exploring the East Tennessee's beautiful landscape.
