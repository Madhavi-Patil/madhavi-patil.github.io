Severe disease epidemics in wild plant pathosystems are rare when compared to crop pathosystems. Genetic heterogeneity of the hosts is a significant feature of wild plant populations. It presumably plays a major role in suppressing the emergence of novel pathogen virulence. **Our research group aims to understand how the genetic makeup of wild grape populations in the Blue Ridge Mountains influences its coevolution with a highly coevolved downy mildew-causing pathogen and vice versa.** 


We integrate fields of:
-  genomics
-  population and evolutionary genomics
-  computational biology
-  ecology
-  plant pathology.


**CoEvolutionLab's long-term goal is to learn evolutionary principles from wild plant pathosystems that will be useful in managing crop diseases sustainably**
